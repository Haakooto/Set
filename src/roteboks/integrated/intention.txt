Intention guide for Set

Hosted on bror.tips there is a continously running file, server.py.
When running playSet.py on your laptop you will join a game hosted there
commandlinearguments can specify if you want to start a new, own game, or join an existing one.
By default you should start a new if there are no other, and join one running if there are. (criteria for which one if multiple is to be worked out later)
You also give a name in commandline. If no name given, or if someone in game already has that, a generic name is assigned

When you make a game/ join one not started you see white screen, maybe with text, and backside of deck in slot 15
when deck is clicked, game starts and board is filled
Later, a tutorial mode can be made
player can join midgame
players joining, current scores and other info is printed in terminal
Game progress as normal
When all cards are used, player with most points is decleared winner, everyone is kicked, and game disconnected
Is easy to start new one

The last card game will not be implemented in v1, but added later, and made optional, but default
